# counter-website

A simple usage of the GitHub REST API that counts how many people have visited this page

The main purpose of this project is to create a proof of concept that GitHub can be used as a storage server.

You might ask "Why on earth would you do this?"
The reason is because I'm broke and don't want to pay for Firebase Firestore.
